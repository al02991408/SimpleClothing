# SimpleClothing Firebase Setup

This document provides instructions for setting up and deploying the SimpleClothing project using Firebase services, including Firestore, Functions, Hosting, and Storage.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- Firebase CLI installed globally (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- A Firebase project created in the Firebase Console

## Firebase Configuration Steps

### 1. Initialize Firebase

Navigate to the `firebase` directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
firebase init
```

Select the following features:
- Firestore
- Functions
- Hosting
- Storage

Follow the prompts to configure each service. Make sure to select the appropriate Firebase project when prompted.

### 2. Set Up Firestore

After initializing, you can define your Firestore security rules in `firestore.rules`. Customize the rules based on your application's requirements.

### 3. Configure Firebase Functions

Navigate to the `functions` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd functions
npm install
```

Edit `src/index.js` to define your cloud functions. You can create HTTP functions or Firestore triggers as needed.

### 4. Deploying to Firebase

To deploy your Firestore rules, Functions, and Hosting, run the following command from the `firebase` directory:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

This command will deploy all selected services to your Firebase project.

### 5. Accessing Firebase Storage

You can manage your storage rules in `storage.rules`. Ensure that you set the appropriate permissions for reading and writing files.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ESLint Linting Problems

If you encounter linting issues, ensure that your ESLint configuration in `functions/.eslintrc.json` is correctly set up. You can run the linter using:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Node.js Version Incompatibilities

Ensure that your local Node.js version matches the version specified in your Firebase Functions configuration. You can check your Node.js version with:

```bash
node -v
```

If necessary, use a version manager like `nvm` to switch to the correct version.
